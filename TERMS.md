# Terms of Service - Ping on Change

**Service.** Ping on Change monitors GitHub Actions results and sends a single alert on first failure and a single alert on recovery per workflow, based on your configuration.

**Acceptable use.** Don’t use the service to spam, violate laws, or circumvent GitHub policies. You must own or be authorized to manage the repositories you connect.

**No SLA.** Provided “as is,” with no uptime or delivery guarantees. Do not rely on the service as your sole incident alerting mechanism.

**Plans & billing.** Billing is handled by GitHub Marketplace. Per GitHub policy, cancellations take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

**Suspension/termination.** We may suspend for abuse, security risk, or non-payment. On Marketplace **effective cancellation** or **uninstall**, we deactivate immediately and delete personal data within 30 days (tombstone only, no PII retained).

**Security.** Least-privilege GitHub scopes (Actions: read; Metadata: read). Data processed on Cloudflare Workers/KV; all network access over TLS.

**Liability.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential damages. Aggregate liability is limited to fees paid in the 3 months preceding the claim.
